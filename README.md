intend to be a tool to build landscape in minecraft using shapefile formate,
next step, build city model using detailed city map.
This have been a idea for long time, untill one day a high-school student build
Chinese map basicly by hand(with some bursh tools) in minecraft.
I have more time, and tools, and knowlege, I shoud have done that, isn't it?
So, let's get started.
